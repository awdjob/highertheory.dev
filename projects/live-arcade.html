    <h1>Live Arcade</h1>
    <div class="project-description">
      A gamified support system for Twitch streamers. Viewers purchase tokens to play arcade games on stream — when they set a new high score, their name is broadcast live. Every token supports the channel.
    </div>

        <h3>How It Works</h3>
        <p>
          Live Arcade brings your viewers front and center by turning support into gameplay. They buy tokens to play arcade-style games directly on stream — and when they hit a high score, their name takes the spotlight live.
        </p>

        <h3>Designed for Streamers</h3>
        <p>
          Everything is opt-in and customizable. You choose which games are active, set limits on play, and control how shout-outs appear. It’s all about boosting engagement without losing control of your stream.
        </p>

        <h3>Under the Hood</h3>
        <p>
          Built using Electron for the desktop overlay, with a backend powered by Node.js and WebSockets for real-time updates. Game logic is written in TypeScript, and all player data is stored securely using Supabase.
        </p>
