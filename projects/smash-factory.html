      Smash Factory is an all-in-one tool for streamlining live Smash tournaments — from bracket management and seeding to on-stream overlays and player data syncing.

      <p>
        Designed for locals and grassroots events, Smash Factory integrates directly with major tournament platforms (like Start.gg and Challonge) to automatically sync brackets, track matches, and deliver real-time overlays to your stream.
      </p>
      <p>
        Built with competitive TOs in mind, it eliminates manual busywork and improves the spectator experience with dynamic player cards, character stats, and scene switching logic. It’s currently used weekly in live events and continues to evolve with direct feedback from the community.
