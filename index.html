        I'm just a guy with a guitar who codes trying to get better at both. I’ve been building things on the web since the early 2000s, starting with Simpsons-themed websites I hosted from my family computer using Netscape Composer and WAMP. I was hooked from the beginning.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2010, I decided to take things seriously. I started with HTML and CSS, moved into PHP, and then found my home in Ruby on Rails. Since then, I’ve spent most of my career working with Rails and JavaScript/Node — and more recently, I’ve been diving deeper into Go.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ve always been less interested in writing code for the sake of it, and more focused on building things that actually work — things that solve problems and can become businesses.
      </p>
      <p>
        That’s what Higher Theory Dev is all about. We create full product walkthroughs and explore a wide range of code-related topics. We share these through a variety of long- and short-form content, showing what it really looks like to bring ideas to life — from the messy early stages all the way to launch and beyond.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you're learning, building, or just curious how real software gets made, you’re welcome here. Ask questions, follow along, and grow with us.
      </p>
      <p>
        We’re building in public — and you’re invited.
